# Zeolite-analyser code

This code measure some geometric features for an overall database. It enables the assessment of a multitude of geometric characteristics of the frameworks, and it reads CIF files of the periodic structures with P1 space group and SiO2 compositions.  It is a new version of the https://github.com/salrodgom/GeoZeoForCIFFileDatabase code. Some new functionalities have been added.
